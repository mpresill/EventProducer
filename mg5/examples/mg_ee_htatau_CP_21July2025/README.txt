Here is the glossary for the labels I have used in naming the samples

- _mod1 (DONE):
    includes all tau+- decays to pi+- v, pi+- pi0 v (so 4 final states)  - approx 36% each 
    no restict cards, i.e. all massive particles 

- _mod2 (ongoing):
    includes all tau+- decays to leptons (so 4 final states )  - approx 34% each
    no restict cards, i.e. all massive particles 

- _mod2_wMadspin (ongoing):
    includes all tau+- decays to leptons (so 4 final states )  - approx 34% each
    no restict cards, i.e. all massive particles 
    decays of higgs boson are handled by madspin

- _mod3 :
